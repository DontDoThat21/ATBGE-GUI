Crudely written WPF UI app that automatically posts with configurable settings to X/formerly Twitter.

This was written by a Junior developer, learning the ropes, as a side idea/PoC for a pal.

With Elon's aquisition, it's clear X is no longer friendly and accepting of bots so beware.
Not sure how much future development this will have.
